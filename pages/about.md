Hi, I’m Suhwan, and I’m glad you’re here!

In my work, I’m focused on building predictive forecasting and risk management models that go beyond theory. I have extensive experience of developing, deploying, and operationalizing these models through business process integration.

Right now, I’m working in the banking sector, where I develop and manage transaction monitoring models for Anti-Money Laundering compliance. Before this, I spent three years leading a machine learning research project at a major medical technology company, where we developed machine learning models for supply chain demand forecasting. That experience not only transformed how we approached demand predictions, but also set the foundation for my Ph.D. research in large-scale time series forecasting.

While pursuing my Ph.D., I founded DataMeka here in Singapore, a machine learning playground to host machine learning competitions focused on regional topics across Southeast Asia. Through partnerships with leading universities in Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam, we’ve ended up runnnig five major competitions, live webinars, machine learning bootcamps during the past two years. 

On the personal side, my family means the world to me. My amazing wife and our two wonderful children are my biggest supporters and constant source of motivation.

Thanks for stopping by – I hope you find something here that inspires you!
