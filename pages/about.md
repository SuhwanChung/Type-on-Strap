Howdy! I'm Suhwan, and I’m thrilled you’re here. Welcome to my blog!

So, who am I? Well, I like to say my life revolves around a “triangular” approach, both personally and professionally. Yep, triangles—three strong points that define who I am. You’ll even see this theme reflected in my website's logo.

First, there's my expertise in AI and machine learning. Over the past eight years, I’ve been working with predicive analytics at large organizations. My mission? To help teams—and sometimes whole companies—transform and transform operations through predictive solutions.

Second, there’s my dive into quantitative trading. At UBS, I work in non-financial risk modeling, and I’ve recently started to explore quant modeling, especially high-frequency trading. In my free time, I experiment with investment strategies.

And third, my love for investment rounds out the triangle. AI/ML, quant modeling, and investing are the pillars of my work, and you’ll find insights, projects, and stories about them as you explore my site.

My academic path also fits the triangular theme. I earned a Bachelor’s in Business from Dankook University, followed by a Master’s in Data Science from the National University of Singapore, and then a PhD in Machine Learning from Nanyang Technological University. Three schools, three degrees (although leaving PhD without completing disseration), and my commitment to learning.

On the personal side, I’m all about my family. My incredible wife, our smart daughter, and our handsome son keep life fulfilling. They’re my biggest supporters and constant sources of inspiration.

Dive in, explore, and I hope you enjoy getting a glimpse into the projects and passions that drive me.
