Howdy! I'm Suhwan. Welcome to my blog, and thanks for stopping by.

My life, both personally and professionally, revolves around three key aspects—what I like to call my “triangular” approach. You’ll notice this theme reflected in my website's logo.

From a skills standpoint, I’ve spent the past eight years driving change through :one: AI and machine learning at large organizations. My focus has been to help teams—and sometimes entire companies—achieve greater operational efficiency by leveraging AI/ML.

The second aspect of my triangle is :two: quantit trading. In my current role at UBS, I’m involved in non-financial risk modeling. This year, I’ve extended my interest into :two: quant modeling (mostly HFT) and experimented own investment strategy in my free time.

Finally, there’s my passion for :three: investment. These three elements—AI/ML, quant modeling, and investment—shape my unique approach, and you will see my views, working projects in this website.

Academically, my journey also follows a triangular path. I earned a `Bachelor’s in Business` from Dankook University, a `Master’s in Data Science` from the National University of Singapore, and a `PhD in machine learning` from Nanyang Technological University.

Personally, I’m head over heels for my little family: :one: my incredible wife, :two: our sweet daughter, :three: our brave son. They're my biggest supporters and constant source of inspiration.
