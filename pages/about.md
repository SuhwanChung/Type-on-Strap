Over the past eight years, I've been extensively applying AI/ML to drive change at large organizations. I've focused on helping teams—and sometimes entire companies—identify risks and drive opeartional efficiency. 

I earned my Bachelor’s in Business Administration from [Dankook University](https://www.dankook.ac.kr/web/international), followed by a Master’s in Data Science from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I then pursued a PhD at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), focusing my research on large time series models.

My family and I have been happily settled in Singapore for the past eight years. I live here with my wonderful wife and our two kids, Ain and Gunwoo.
